                    Karen has always been passionate about organizational design and how to bring structure and order to chaos. Until she found UX/UI, she lacked the skills to use this passion to serve others.
                    <br>She studied communications in college and got her master’s in mass communications. She learned how to study both media and people very well, and wrote her thesis on state governments’ use of social media to connect with constituents.
                    <br>Her professional experience has spanned many industries, but has consistently included work in operations with an emphasis on organizational efficiency. She has also heavily utilized data in every position. Find out more about her professional background on LinkedIn.
